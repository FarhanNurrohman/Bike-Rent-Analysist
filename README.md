# Proyek Analisis Data: Bike Sharing Dataset
## Bike Rental Data Analysis and Interactive Dashboard Using Streamlit
This project focuses on analyzing bike rental data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to bike-sharing services. An interactive dashboard built with Streamlit allows users to dynamically explore the data and visualize key metrics for decision-making.

### Key Features
* Data Cleaning and Preparation: Processing raw bike rental data to handle missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing trends in rental demand, user behavior, seasonal variations, and correlations with weather conditions.
* Interactive Dashboard: A Streamlit-powered dashboard for visualizing:
* Hourly, daily, and monthly rental patterns
* Impact of weather, temperature, and holidays on rentals
* User segmentation (e.g., casual vs. registered users)
* Peak rental times and popular locations
*Insights and Recommendations: Data-driven insights to optimize bike availability, pricing, and marketing strategies.
### Tools and Technologies
* Python: Core language for data analysis and visualization.
* Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and computation.
*Matplotlib & Seaborn: For generating static visualizations.
*Streamlit: For creating an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.
### Dataset
The dataset contains detailed records of bike rentals, including timestamps, user types, weather conditions, and rental counts, providing a comprehensive view of bike-sharing usage patterns.

### Results
The project delivers actionable insights into rental trends and highlights the factors influencing bike usage. The interactive dashboard allows stakeholders to easily explore and interpret the data to make informed decisions.
